My research interests are varied, and include social demography, health and mortality, deviance and crime, complexity and social network analysis, computational sociology, and quantitative methods. I am currently involved in the following research projects:

## Dissertation: Income Mobility, Health and Mortality

Recent research on U.S. income mobility and health using community and individual data shows that higher  mobility is associated with lower mortality risks. That relationship seems to be stronger and more consistent than the relationship between income inequality and health (a topic widely studied), although considerably smaller than the impact of income on mortality. This preliminary evidence suggests that income mobility might be a relevant determinant of health and mortality. Surprisingly, this potential pathway has received little attention in the literature.

My dissertation builds on that small literature and examines the robustness of the relationship between income mobility and health at the aggregate and individual level. By using different data sources and modeling approaches, I describe the magnitude and variability of this association in the U.S., and explore the plausibility and consistency of explanations offered in the literature. The central argument is that the effect of income mobility on health is stronger and larger than the impact of income inequality and that the mechanisms behind it, although related to income inequality, are theoretically distinct and independent of those of income and inequality, and can have powerful and lasting consequences.

To ground this argument, I use two strategies. First, I analyze aggregate and individual data to assess the magnitude, robustness, and variability of the *effects* of income mobility, and empirically examine whether some of the potential pathways and mechanisms proposed in the literature are supported by the data. Secondly, building on this evidence, I use a theoretical model to assess the conditions and plausibility of the potential mechanisms involved in the  association between income mobility and health. By formulating a generative model, where I precisely define (represent) a set of mechanisms (causal relationships) likely to bring about the observed patterns, I am able to assess the internal consistency of the theory and evaluate its generative sufficiency.

We test the conjecture that intergenerational social mobility is tightly linked to adult mortality even after accounting for income levels, income inequality, and indicators of social capital, health behaviors and levels of access to health services. We use a large dataset from The Health Inequality Project and estimate simple multivariate models with U.S. counties and commuting zones as units of analysis. We find that the estimated effects of indicators of social mobility are strong and in the expected direction, robust to model specification, and translate into differences in life expectancy at age 40 as large 2.0-4.8 years among males and 0.1-2.0 among females. These are equivalent to 5.1-12.5 and 0.2-4.7 percent of the U.S. average life expectancy at age 40 among males and females respectively. On average, the magnitude of these effects is 1.5 to 2.5 times as large as those of income inequality and about 40 (males) and 25 (females) percent of the magnitude of a change from the lowest to the highest quartile of the U.S. income distribution.

<!-- ### Intergenerational transfers in the U.S., economic inequality, and social stratification (with [Alberto Palloni](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/faculty/show-person.php?person_id=38))

This paper contributes to the literature on intergenerational transfers in three ways. First, we estimate prevalence, direction and magnitudes of money transfers from parents to children (PtC) in the U.S. over a period of nearly 18 years (1992-2010). Second, we use these estimates to test the conjecture that an important, albeit not the only, motive for transfers is socioeconomic status preservation. Third, we show that although the quantities of intervivos transfers are small relative to bequests, they are unequally distributed and large enough to exert some influence on intergenerational mobility. We use ten waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and estimate models of PtC within parent-child dyads, account for within-household dependency of multiple transfers, for reciprocal influence of PtC transfers to siblings, and for the influence of transfers in the opposite direction, from children to parents (CtP). We uncover sharp inequalities in PtC transfers by wealth class and amounts that are not trivial, particularly in the wealthiest groups. We conclude that both the skewness of PtC distribution and the absolute magnitudes involved could potentially affect income and wealth inequalities in successive generations.

<!-- ### Exploring the consequences of adolescent sex in behavioral context (with [Eric Grodsky](http://ssc.wisc.edu/soc/faculty/show-person.php?person_id=859) and [Ann Meier](http://www.soc.umn.edu/~meierann/))

A substantial body of research has shown a negative relationship between adolescent sexual activity and outcomes such as self-esteem, depression, and academic achievement. Recent studies, however, suggest that detrimental effects of sexual activity are conditional on the social context in which this behavior occurs and also the meanings youth ascribe to sexual behavior. We add to this literature by considering the configuration of behaviors in which adolescent sex occurs as a marker of the social meaning of sexual intercourse. This paper explores how sexual intercourse, co-occurring with adolescent behaviors commonly regarded as deviant, is related to mental health and schooling outcomes. Our results show little evidence for variation of the relationship between sexual intercourse on these outcomes across behavioral contexts. However, our point estimates for conditional coefficients suggest more confidence in invariant "effects" of sexual activity for typical adolescents than for those engaged in problem behaviors such as substance use and fighting. -->

<!-- ## Consequences of Childbearing in Delinquency and Substance Use (with [Jason Fletcher](https://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/jason-fletcher))

 This paper uses the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and recent empirical strategies to examine the dynamic consequences of parenthood on delinquency and substance use. We take advantage of the miscarriage information available to form comparison groups. Our contribution is to extend the analysis of the effects of childbearing to deviant outcomes such as delinquency and substance use, and explore the  differences between motherhood and fatherhood. Our preliminary results suggest reductions in risky behaviors from childbearing. We do not find evidence of heterogeneity across socioeconomic status.

<!-- ### Selection / Influence of Adolescent Violence (with [Jason Fletcher](https://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/jason-fletcher))

This paper examines the co-evolution of friendship and violence over a period of five years using a school-based sample of adolescents from Northern Ireland (The Belfast Youth Development Study).  We estimate a dynamic network model to decompose selection and influence effects of violence while controlling for endogenous network change. Given the size of our sample, we can also explore heterogeneity in our estimates across schools and assess to what extent the observed differences are explained by characteristics of the schools such as size, SES, religion, and gender composition. Thus, we contribute to this literature providing selection/influence violence estimates from a considerably larger sample than previous studies and going beyond school idiosyncrasies. Most importantly, we examine how heterogeneous these dynamics are across different local contexts and identify factors that are the most important. These results will, potentially, improve violence prevention strategies in the school context.    -->

### The Consequences of Incarceration for Health and Mortality
*with Alberto Palloni and Jerrett Jones*


In light of the expansion of the criminal justice system, researchers have become increasingly interested in the social consequences of incarceration. A line of this research suggests that incarceration has negative implications for individuals’ health and well-being at older ages. However, prior studies are limited in that they have not adequately followed former prisoners over a sufficient time period to determine whether incarceration significantly increases mortality. 

This project contributes to this growing literature by employing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a long longitudinal data resource, to examine the consequences of incarceration for health and mortality. First, we estimate the effect of short and long-term effects of incarceration on mortality and disability over a period of nearly 40 years. Second, we use those estimates and different counterfactual scenarios to assess to what extent mass incarceration contributes to the so called U.S. health disadvantage.

## Chile Re-entry Study
*with Pilar Larroulet and Catalina Droppelmann*

This study, funded by the San Carlos de Maipo Foundation, is an intensive longitudinal data collection of a sample of about 300 women leaving prison in Santiago, Chile. We are using interviews over a period of a year to examine the employment, family life, housing, and health of women just released from prison, but also, qualitative interviews to examine in more detail re-entry experience. We are in the early stages of the project, designing questionnaire and organizing the fieldwork. 

## RSiena Selection and Influence Estimates Under Misspecification
*with Kurt Kreuger*

Although the statistical estimation of selection and influence effects has proven to be extremely difficult, new methods have been proposed recently. Among them, one of the most prominent efforts that have gained popularity during the last ten years is the Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model (Siena) proposed by Tom A. B. Snijders and colleagues. This method has been applied to estimate selection and influence effects in a wide range of behaviors and traits including substance use, delinquency, violence, health, and educational attainment. However, we know little about the conditions for which this method is reliable. In this project, we use an Agent-based model (ABM) to assess under which circumstances Siena is able to provide a good representation of the selection and influence processes of a social system, and how robust its results are to misspecification (e.g., heterogeneity).
