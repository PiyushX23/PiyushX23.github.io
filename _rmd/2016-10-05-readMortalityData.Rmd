Reading  fixed-width text files can be challenging, especially when no manageable dictionary is provided. In this post, I show steps can save you time. In this example, I read a compress mortality file (CMF 1979-1988) available [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/cmf.htm) using a layout (or dictionary) in [PDF format](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/mortab/filelayout68_88.pdf).

So, to read this file (usually with extension `.txt` or `.dat`), I first need to know where each column starts and finishes. What I get from the pdf file is something like this:

The layout is usually a codebook in Word/PDF or just plain text file. Here, I copy the PDF text and put it in a plain text file. I use a text editor (e.g., [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)) and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to extract the information I need.

I have to select every row with this pattern: `1-2 2 FIPS State code Numeric`. That is, a number follows by a hyphen (although not always, particularly when the width of the column is one), spaces, another number, spaces, and then any text. I use the following regular expression to get that pattern: `(^[0-9]+).([0-9]+)\s+([0-9])\s+(.+)`. Using the Sublime package [Filter Lines](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Filter%20Lines) I get something like this (you can also just copy the selected lines):

This approach might be particularly useful when you have a long PDF/Word file and you want to extract most of the variables of a dataset. You would need to adapt these regular expressions to the particular patterns of your codebook.

To simplify, I format this text as a comma-separated values file (csv) so that to read it in R. Replacing this regular expression `([0-9]+)(-)([0-9]+)(\s)([0-9]+)(\s)(.+)(\s)(Numeric)` by `\1,\3,\5,\7,\9` I get:

![](/img/filterLinesCSV.png)

Then, I read that file in R.

    ```{r}
    # define names of columns
    colnames <- c("start", "end", "width", "name", "type")
    dict <- read.csv("data/dictMortality.csv", col.names = colnames, header = FALSE)
    ```

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    dict
    ```
Now, I can read the fixed-width text file. I use the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) package (in my experience relatively fast for big databases, let's say, 1GB).

   ```{r, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
   library(readr)

   # create name of variables
   cnames <- c("state", "county", "year", "age", "icd", "cause", "deaths")

   # read mortality file
   mort <- read_fwf("data/mort7988.txt", fwf_positions(dict$start, dict$end, cnames))
   ```

   ```{r, echo = FALSE}
   mort
   ```

    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
   # year distribution
   table(mort$year)

   # number of deaths
   sum(mort$deaths)
   ```

Hopefully, you will save some time.
