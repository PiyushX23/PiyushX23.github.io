Reading fixed-format file can be challenging, especially when no manageable dictionary is provided. In this post, I show some steps can save you time when reading this type of file. In this example, I am going to read a compress mortality file (CMF 1979-1988) available [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/cmf.htm). The file layout (or dictionary) in PDF format can be obtained [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/mortab/filelayout68_88.pdf).

So, to read this file (in general with extension `.txt`, `.dat`), I first need to know where each column starts and finished. What I get from the pdf file is something like this:

These files are usually codebooks in Word/PDF or just plain text files. Here, I copy the PDF text and put it in a plain text file. I use a text editor (e.g., [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)) and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to extract the information I need.

I have to select every row with this pattern: `1-2 2 FIPS State code Numeric`. That is, a number follows by a hyphen (not always, particularly when the width of the column is one), spaces, another number, spaces, and then any text. I use the following regular expression to get that pattern: `(^[0-9]+).([0-9]+)\s+([0-9])\s+(.+)`. Using the Sublime package [Filter Lines](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Filter%20Lines) I get something like this (you can also just copy the selected lines):

This approach might be particularly useful when you have a long PDF/Word and you want to extract most of the variables of the dataset. You would need to adapt these regular expressions to the particular patterns of your codebook.

Just to simplify, I format this text as comma-separates values (csv) file so that to read it in R. Replacing this regular expression `([0-9]+)(-)([0-9]+)(\s)([0-9]+)(\s)(.+)(\s)(Numeric)` by `\1,\3,\5,\7,\9` I get:

![](/img/filterLinesCSV.png)

I read this file in R.

    ```{r}
    # define names of columns
    colnames <- c("start", "end", "width", "name", "type")
    dict <- read.csv("data/dictMortality.csv", col.names = colnames, header = FALSE)
    ```

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    dict
    ```
Now, we can read the fixed-format file. I use the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) package (in my experience relatively fast for big databases, let's say, 1GB).

   ```{r, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
   library(readr)

   # create name of variables
   cnames <- c("state", "county", "year", "age", "icd", "cause", "deaths")

   # read mortality file
   mort <- read_fwf("data/mort7988.txt", fwf_positions(dict$start, dict$end, cnames))
   ```

   ```{r, echo = FALSE}
   mort
   ```

    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
   # year distribution
   table(mort$year)

   # number of deaths
   sum(mort$deaths)
   ```

Hopefully, you will save some time.
