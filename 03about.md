I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my Bachelors and Masters in Sociology from the Catholic University of Chile.

During my Ph.D., I have learned much about demography, crime, complexity and social networks. I am eager to combine my deviance/criminology interest with demography and agent-based models.

In this blog I will share material from projects in which I am working on, discoveries, discussions, and ideas. This site is a work in progress and I welcome any feedback.
