## Prospective Postdoc
I'm always looking for postdocs to join my lab at Northeastern. Opportinuties are based on pending fundings. I am also happy to discuss opportunities and ideas of external fellowships.


## Prospective Graduate Students

I am seeking graduate students to join my lab at Northeastern in Fall 2025. Prospective students with similar research interests are strongly encouraged to apply. Graduate students will primarily be supported through research assistantships, but I am also open to discussing opportunities for external fellowships.

The application deadline is December 1, 2024. See more details of the application [here](https://cos.northeastern.edu/admissions/graduate-programs/how-to-apply/#1590696861008-27b875e2-7000)


Please email me the following information if you are interested. Note that sending these documents does not constitute a formal application.

●	A 1-page cover letter (please explain your research interests, why you are interested in joining, and your experience working with programming/climate/statistics/physcis);

●	Your most recent CV, including contact information for three references;

●	PDFs of writing samples (e.g. peer-reviewed article, thesis, essay, preprint; up to 3) 


## Undergraduate Students
If you are interested in gaining research experience in our lab's focus areas, please email me.
