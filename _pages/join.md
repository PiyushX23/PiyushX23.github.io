## Prospective Postdoc
Our lab is always looking for postdocs at Northeastern in climate dynamics and paleoclimate. Opportinuties are based on pending fundings, but I am also happy to discuss opportunities and ideas of external fellowships from [NOAA](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc), [NSF](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/atmospheric-geospace-sciences-postdoctoral), and [McDonnell Foundation](https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/).



## Prospective Graduate Students

Our lab is seeking graduate students to join my lab at Northeastern in Fall 2025. Prospective students with similar research interests are strongly encouraged to apply. Graduate students will primarily be supported through research assistantships, but I am also open to discussing opportunities for external fellowships from [NASA](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/future-investigators-in-nasa-earth-and-space-science-and-technology-finesst-2/), [NSF](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), and [AMS](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/information-for/students/ams-scholarships-and-fellowships/ams-graduate-fellowships/).

The application deadline is December 1, 2024. See more details of the application [here](https://cos.northeastern.edu/admissions/graduate-programs/how-to-apply/#1590696861008-27b875e2-7000).



Please email me the following information if you are interested. Note that sending these documents does not constitute a formal application.



●	A 1-page cover letter (please explain your research interests, why you are interested in joining, and your experience working with programming/climate/statistics/physcis);

●	Your most recent CV, including contact information for three references;



## Undergraduate Students
If you are interested in gaining research experience in our lab's focus areas, please email me.Undergraduates are also encouraged to apply for scholarships from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/office-education/hollings-scholarship), [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/), and [AMS](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/information-for/students/ams-scholarships-and-fellowships/women-in-science-scholarship/).
