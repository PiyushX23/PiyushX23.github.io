Iâ€™m a sociologist, demographer, and data scientist studying health disparities, the criminal justice system's consequences for health and social integration, and the link between health inequalities and epigenetics. 

I rely on statistical and computational methods in my research, emphasizing data science, and agent-based modeling.

I received my PhD in sociology from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/) and currently I am working as a Senior Researcher at the project [ECHO](https://echo-erc.csic.es/) with Alberto Palloni.

I received my Bachelors and Masters in Sociology from the [Catholic University of Chile](http://sociologia.uc.cl/), where I still collaborate with the [Center for the Study of Justice and Society](http://justiciaysociedad.uc.cl/).
