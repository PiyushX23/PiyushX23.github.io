I'm a climate modeler, data scientist, and keyboard enthusiast with a passion for advancing our comprehension of climate change.

I began my Ph.D. in the [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) department](https://www.aos.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. However, due to my advisor's new faculty appointment, I transferred to [The Ohio State University](https://geography.osu.edu/), where I ultimately received my Ph.D. Prior to this, I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Meteorology from the [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://en.nuist.edu.cn/mainm.htm) in China.

My research falls broadly under two fundamental questions: *(1) What are the causes of past and future changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation and climate variability? (2) How can we quantitatively interpret these changes and their impacts?* I use an interdisciplinary research approach that combines a hierarchy of climate models, isotope-enabled modeling, statistical and machine learning techniques, and observations/paleoclimate proxies, aiming toward a better understanding of the physical processes that govern climate dynamics in the past and future. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the department of physical oceanography at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/), committed to conducting impactful research on global climate change. Prior to moving to WHOI, I was a postdoc at RSMAS in the [University of Miami](https://www.earth.miami.edu/).

Starting in January 2025, I will be an assistant professor at Northeastern University in Boston. **If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in climate modeling and dynamics, please contact me!**
