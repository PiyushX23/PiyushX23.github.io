I'm a sociologist, data scientist, and social demographer working in the industry and academic projects.

I received my Ph.D. in sociology from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/) and my Bachelor's and Master's in Sociology from the [Catholic University of Chile](http://sociologia.uc.cl/). 

My **academic work** focuses on health disparities, criminal justice system's consequences for health and social integration, and the link between health inequalities and genetics. My research relies on statistical and computational methods, emphasizing data science and agent-based modeling (ABM).

Currently, I am working as a **Senior Data Scientist** at [Lookiero](https://lookiero.es/). I am also an **external faculty** (Fall 2022-2023) in the Master in [Computational Social Science UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/master/computational-social-science), and collaborate with the [Center for the Study of Justice and Society](http://justiciaysociedad.uc.cl/) of the Catholic University of Chile.
