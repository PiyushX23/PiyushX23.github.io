I'm a climate modeler, data scientist, and keyboard enthusiast with a passion for advancing our comprehension of climate change.

I receuved my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences from the [Ohio State University](https://geography.osu.edu/) and my Bachelor's and Master's in Meteorology from the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.

My research falls broadly under two fundamental questions: **(1) What are the causes of past and future changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation and climate variability? (2) How can we quantitatively interpret these changes and their impacts?** I use an interdisciplinary research approach that combines a hierarchy of climate models, isotope-enabled modeling, statistical and machine learning techniques, and observations/paleoclimate proxies, aiming toward a better understanding of the physical principles that govern climate dynamics in the past and future. 

Currently, I am serving as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Miami, committed to conducting impactful research on the North Atlantic climate change.
