The re-entry study is an intensive longitudinal project that follows more than 200 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile. It is funded by the [San Carlos de Maipo](http://www.fsancarlos.cl/) and [Colunga](https://www.fundacioncolunga.org/) Foundation, and the [Inter-American Development Bank](http://www.iadb.org/). We used interviews over a period of one year to know their experiences on  family life, housing, employment, social capital and health. Data collection finished in 2018.
