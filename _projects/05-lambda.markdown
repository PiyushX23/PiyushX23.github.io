*with Alberto Palloni and Hiram Beltran-Sanchez*

The [Latin American Mortality Database](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cdha/latinmortality/) (LAMBdA) was originally created to support the empirical study of the history of mortality trends in Latin American countries after independence. It now supports the study of very recent mortality trends and is particularly suited for the study of old age mortality during the post-WWII period.

The database covers the interval between 1848 and 2014, it includes population censuses, age-specific (five year and single year age groups) total death counts (starting in 1900), and by causes of deaths (starting in 1945). It contains over 170 years of data including adjusted life tables (about 500 life tables). In this project, we assess estimate and model uncertainty of the association between life expectancy and economic progress using Bayesian models and stacking.
