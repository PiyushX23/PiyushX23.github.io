This paper presents a novel remote sensing algorithm designed to accurately measure cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations at different altitudes using data from airborne and spaceborne lidar systems. By providing vertically resolved CCN profiles, the study enhances our understanding of cloud formation processes and their impact on climate. This breakthrough allows for more precise climate modeling and better predictions of weather patterns, offering valuable insights for both scientific research and practical applications in meteorology and environmental monitoring. The algorithm represents a significant advancement in atmospheric science, enabling more detailed and accurate observations of cloud microphysics.
