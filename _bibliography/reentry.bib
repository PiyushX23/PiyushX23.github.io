  abstract = {The last decades' increase in female incarceration has translated into an increasing number of women released from prison. Understanding their characteristics and criminal trajectories can enlighten us regarding the different needs of women reentering society after incarceration. Drawing on data from the Reinserci{\'o}n, Desistimiento y Reincidencia en Mujeres Privadas de Libertad en Chile Study, this article identifies different profiles among a cohort of 225 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile; showing that there is significant heterogeneity among them in terms of their criminal trajectories and intervention' needs to support their transition out of prison.},

  abstract = {Life course criminology has long argued that having a job may act as a turning point in trajectories of offending, moving individuals toward conventional activities. However, most of the extant evidence is based on male samples in developed countries, particularly the United States. 
Studies on females have found a less consistent effect of employment on desistance from crime, particularly for women transitioning to society after incarceration. The fact that work does not appear to be a clear turning point among women might be due to female ex-inmates being more likely to access unstable and insecure jobs. Unfortunately, most of the available gendered research focuses on formal employment, restricting our ability to understand job trajectories among incarcerated women.  Our paper describes trajectories of employment among women released from prison, using data from the ``Reintegration, desistance and recidivism among female inmates in Chile'' study, which followed a cohort of women (n=225) released in Santiago, Chile, during a 12-month period. 
Using sequence analysis, we explore monthly patterns of employment considering different types of work in terms of formality, schedule, and protection. To better account for the complex relationship between the two activities, we include offending as a type of work. Finally, we use regression models to explore individual determinants of employment trajectories among women.
We expect to find that female employment trajectories after release will be characterized by informal and unstable employment. Although we hypothesize that those who continue offending would be less likely to be employed, we also expect to see a more nuanced relationship, with precarious employment being also associated with offending. Finally, we expect to find significant differences among women, such that more disadvantaged women are more likely to be unemployed for the whole period.},
